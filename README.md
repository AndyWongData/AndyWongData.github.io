# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository was forked from [Guglielmo Cerri](https://github.com/GuglielmoCerri/GuglielmoCerri.github.io) and adapted to fit my personal needs.

Within this portfolio, you'll find a brief overview of
- Who I am
- My academic/work experience
- My projects
- My technical skills

At the bottom, there's a contact form that sends an email to my direct inbox. Please feel free to reach out for anything!
